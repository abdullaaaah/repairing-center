The warranty includes the repaired part(s) only and does not include further accidental damage to the repaired part(s).
    2.2.6	All charges will be subject to VAT and any other government taxes or duties as applicable. VAT is included in the quote.

If issues arise please contact us and we can reassess the damage. In cases where further repair is needed there may be additional costs incurred.
